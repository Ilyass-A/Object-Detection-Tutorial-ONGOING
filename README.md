# Object Detection Tutorial   
This repisotory contians the basic structure to build a object detection model. For that I used my webcam.
### Setup and Installation
It is necessary to execute these steps in order to run the code. I used cmd to execute the following steps:
1. Creation of a virtual enviroment:  
`python -m venv your_environment_name`
2. Activation of the virtual environment:  
`.\environment_name\Scripts\activate`  
3. Upgrade pip:  
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. Installion of ipykernel:   
`pip install ipykernel`
5. Installion of the virtual environment to jupyter Notebook:  
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=obdec`
